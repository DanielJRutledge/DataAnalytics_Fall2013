All phases of project Data should be stored somewhere in this tree. We can decide precisely how to arrange this later.
I would recommend maintaining clear documentation practices and including csv versions of all relevant data files. It'll
be much easier to manage.

Here's some handy tags:
<p> <b>Tags, you're it.</b> </p>

<ul> 
<li>Don't list me without order. </li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li> Ok that's better. </li>
</ol>
